# HTML/CSS Generator

## Inspiration
<aside>
ðŸ›—I was driving in the car on the way to work, and I came across a youtube channel that talked about envisioning your life and the kind of work you want to be doing. A few things came to mind, and it made me feel as intended - *happy and content*.

The next thing that came to mind was this very idea - creating a product that generates/retrieves UI & UX components and other bits of starter code so that you donâ€™t have to keep looking around for that bit of code you saved from some time ago.
This product can save you some minor inconvenience (you know - those times where you look at your screen with dread because you donâ€™t want to have to write that form for the *13th* time) and can help you get to the portion of your work where youâ€™re solving problems unique to you and your code.
